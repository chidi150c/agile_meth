Configuring the dashboard, training of team members and documentation usually follow after all the earlier tasks have been completed. Periodic review is an ongoing task after the implementation is done.



Derived Tasks for Goal 9: Develop an iterative product roadmap that emphasizes continuous improvements upon the e-commerce platform.       
1. Define Business Goals and Requirements: Work with key stakeholders to define business objectives and specific requirements for the e-commerce platform. Important details to understand include target audience, key features, and necessary integrations.

2. Market Research: Conduct market research to understand competitors, identify industry standards, and gather customer feedback that can help improve our e-commerce platform.

3. Draft Initial Roadmap: Create an initial product roadmap that illustrates the phased rollout of features and improvements. This should include broad phases like 'MVP', 'First Update', 'Second Update' etc., and the features or improvements planned under each phase.

4. Design UI/UX Iterations: Considering the findings from the market research, design the initial user interface and experience for the e-commerce platform.

5. Develop MVP: The Development team will begin building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as outlined in the initial roadmap. This will be a simplified version of the final e-commerce platform, including only its core features.

6. Test MVP: Before any user gets to interact with the platform, quality assurance (QA) teams must perform intensive testing to ensure usability, functionality, and stability.

7. Launch MVP: Deploy the tested MVP to a limited audience for real world feedback and user behavior analysis.

8. Collect and Analyze User Feedback: Establish a process for collecting and analyzing user feedback on the MVP for valuable insights on what works and what doesn’t, leading to a list of potential improvements.

9. Reiterate the Roadmap: Based on user feedback and business requirements, update the roadmap for the next enhancement phase.

10. Implement Improvements: Start working on the improvements and new features per the updated roadmap and implement these enhancements in the next iteration of the product.

11. Repeat Steps 7 to 10 for Continuous Improvement: After every improvement phase, release the updated version of the product, gather user feedback, update the roadmap, and plan/implement the next round of enhancements.

Critical Dependencies:
- The project's progression heavily depends on the feedback collected from users, which informs the future iterations in the roadmap.      
- The Design UI/UX Iteration, Develop MVP, Test MVP, and Implement Improvement steps are crucial in iterative developments and have interdependencies. Design changes depend on user feedback, which in turn influences the development and testing phases.

Critical Tasks:
- Define Business Goals and Requirements, Draft Initial Roadmap, and Develop MVP are critical tasks. These steps set the direction for the entire project and are paramount to the success of the e-commerce platform.
