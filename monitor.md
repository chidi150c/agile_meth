Below are Questions and Answers for the VISION clarification

Question 1: What types of web pages do you intend to crawl and what information are you focusing on gathering?
Goal 1: To pinpoint features and necessary functionality for the web crawler and thus determine its overall design and complexity.
Answer 1: Unknown: The vision does not provide specific details on the type of web pages to crawl or the information to gather. However, given the project's aim to enhance understanding of Go's concurrency features, it may be best to choose diverse web pages and focus on various types of information such as text, images, metadata, and response times for maximum complexity and learning exposure.

Question 2: Can you clarify the scale of the project in terms of the number of pages or websites you wish to crawl?        
Goal 2: To assess the level of concurrency required and the probable number of goroutines to be utilized.
Answer 2: Unknown: The specific scale of the project in terms of the number of pages or websites to crawl has not been defined.

Question 3: For our understanding of Go's concurrency, are there any specific concurrency patterns or models in Go you would like us to emphasize or explore?
Goal 3: To expose learners to crucial concurrency models and thereby deepen their comprehension of Go's concurrency.       
Answer 3: I would recommend emphazing on 3 core concurrency models in Go: 1) The Fan Out, Fan In pattern for distributing work across multiple goroutines and collecting their results. 2) Pipeline pattern for chaining operations between goroutines, where the output of one serves as the input to another. 3) The Context pattern for propagating cancellation signals across multiple concurrent operations.

Question 4: Could you further explain how you want channels to be used for communication and synchronization among goroutines?
Goal 4: Guiding in the correct application of channels in synchronization and communication which is a key aspect of Go's concurrency, and directly influences efficiency of the web crawler.
Answer 4: Channels in Go can be used as conduits through which goroutines communicate, thereby achieving synchronization. Basically, a goroutine sends a value into a channel when it's ready for another goroutine to take over. The receiving goroutine then processes data from the channel. This provides a mechanism where one goroutine can wait for data from another, achieving synchronization. By using channels in this project, we aim to manage and synchronize the work of multiple goroutines that will be involved in concurrent web crawling.

Question 5: What is the desired performance for this concurrent web crawler in comparison to a sequential crawler, and how should we validate it?
Goal 5: To set performance targets for the concurrent web crawler. This provides a metric against which to measure the benefits of using Go's concurrent features.
Answer 5: The desired performance of this concurrent web crawler is to process multiple tasks concurrently, significantly faster than a sequential crawler. We can validate it by running tests on the same workload and comparing the processing time between our concurrent web crawler and a standard sequential crawler.

Question 6: Is there any specific error handling or recovery mechanism you'd like for this web crawler?
Goal 6: To provide reliability while crawling websites, dealing with unforeseen errors or exceptions without interrupting the process. Improved error handling contributes to the overall efficiency and robustness of the web crawler.
Answer 6: Unknown:
1. Standard error handling with error messages
2. Retry mechanism for failed requests
3. Panic-recover mechanism for unexpected failure scenarios
4. All of the above combined into a comprehensive error handling and recovery system.
