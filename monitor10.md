- Use feedback to iterate and improve the user experience, engagement, and social interactions within the platform.


Derived Tasks for Goal 5: Implement robust data security measures to protect user information and ensure data accuracy.
1. Conduct a security risk assessment:
- Assess potential vulnerabilities and threats to data security.
- Identify sensitive data that needs protection.
- Evaluate current security measures and gaps.

2. Implement encryption for sensitive data:
- Encrypt user information in databases and during transit.
- Utilize strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) to secure data.

3. Establish access control mechanisms:
- Implement role-based access controls to restrict data access.
- Enforce principle of least privilege to limit user rights.
- Set up monitoring for unauthorized access attempts.

4. Develop data backup and recovery procedures:
- Establish regular data backup schedules.
- Implement mechanisms for data recovery in case of data loss or breach.

5. Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems:
- Install IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities.
- Configure alerts for potential security incidents.

6. Conduct regular security audits and testing:
- Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- Conduct security audits to ensure compliance with security standards.

7. Train employees on data security best practices:
- Provide security awareness training for all staff members.
- Educate employees on phishing prevention and data handling procedures.

8. Monitor and analyze security logs:
- Set up logging mechanisms to track security events.
- Analyze logs for anomalies and security incidents.

9. Stay current with security updates and patches:
- Regularly update software and systems with security patches.
- Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities affecting data security.

10. Document data security policies and procedures:
- Create a comprehensive data security policy document.
- Communicate security procedures to all relevant stakeholders.

Critical Tasks:
- Conduct a security risk assessment.
- Implement encryption for sensitive data.
- Develop data backup and recovery procedures.
- Establish access control mechanisms.

Dependencies:
- Prioritize encryption implementation before access control mechanisms to ensure data protection before access restrictions.

Update Vision:
To empower users to take control of their health and well-being through a user-friendly mobile application that tracks fitness activities, sets goals, and monitors progress.
