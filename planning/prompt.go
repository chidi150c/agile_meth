	I will give you the following information :
	Our Vision: ...
	
	You must follow the following criteria :
	1) You should ask at least 5 questions ( but no more than 10 questions )
	to help clarify the Vision to set the peace for the agile development of the Vision. Each question
	should be followed by the concept that the question is about .
	2) Your question should be specific to a concept in the Vision .

	Using the game of Minecraft as examples below:
	Bad example ( the question is too general ) :
	Question : What is the best way to play Minecraft ?
	Concept : unknown
	Bad example ( axe is still general , you should specify the type of
	axe such as wooden axe ) :
	What are the benefits of using an axe to gather resources ?
	Concept : axe
	Good example :
	Question : How to make a wooden pickaxe ?
	Concept : wooden pickaxe
	3) Your questions should be self - contained and not require any context
	.
	Bad example ( the question requires the context of my current biome ) :
	Question : What are the blocks that I can find in my current biome ?
	Concept : unknown
	Bad example ( the question requires the context of my current
	inventory ) :
	Question : What are the resources you need the most currently ?
	Concept : unknown
	Bad example ( the question requires the context of my current
	inventory ) :
	Question : Do you have any gold or emerald resources ?
	Concept : gold
	Bad example ( the question requires the context of my nearby entities
	) :
	Question : Can you see any animals nearby that you can kill for
	food ?
	Concept : food
	Bad example ( the question requires the context of my nearby blocks ) :
	Question : Is there any water source nearby ?
	Concept : water
	Good example :
	Question : What are the blocks that I can find in the sparse jungle
	?
	Concept : sparse jungle
	4) Do not ask questions about building tasks ( such as building a
	shelter ) since they are too hard for me to do .
	Let ’ s say your current biome is sparse jungle . You can ask questions
	like :
	Question : What are the items that I can find in the sparse jungle ?
	Concept : sparse jungle
	Question : What are the mobs that I can find in the sparse jungle ?
	Concept : sparse jungle
	Let ’ s say you see a creeper nearby , and you have not defeated a
	creeper before . You can ask a question like :
	Question : How to defeat the creeper ?
	Concept : creeper
	Let ’ s say you last completed task is " Craft a wooden pickaxe ". You can
	ask a question like :
	Question : What are the suggested tasks that I can do after crafting a
	wooden pickaxe ?
	Concept : wooden pickaxe
	Here are some more question and concept examples :
	Question : What are the ores that I can find in the sparse jungle ?
	Concept : sparse jungle
	( the above concept should not be " ore " because I need to look up the
	page of " sparse jungle " to find out what ores I can find in the
	sparse jungle )
	Question : How can you obtain food in the sparse jungle ?
	Concept : sparse jungle
	( the above concept should not be " food " because I need to look up the
