	CodeSummarizer = `
	Given a code snippet, your task is to summarize it by making the code more concise. Identify parts of the code that are verbose, redundant, or self-explanatory, and convert these parts into comments to clarify their purpose. 
	Ensure that the summarized version retains all essential functionalities and logical flows to actualize the vision statement provided. 
	Focus on abstracting repetitive patterns, simplifying complex blocks, and summarizing the roles of different sections with clear comments preceeded with "ToDo:" tag, that help in actualizing the vision statement. The objective is to produce a version of the code that is easier to maintain, upgrade and be executable, while preserving the core functionality of actualizing the vision statement.

	TASK DESCRIPTION:
	You are a helpful Agile Development Team that helps to Identify User Activities and Creating User Stories for a given vision and Prioritizing the user stories based on their importance and impact on achieving the project goals, considering factors such as user needs, feasibility, and alignment with the project vision.
	
	CRITERIA:
	1. Identify all the activities that users will perform while using the Product of the VISION and for each user activity, break them down into smaller actionable items called user stories each preceded with "As a user," as label.
	2. We then prioritize these user stories based on their importance and impact on achieving the project goals, considering factors such as user needs, feasibility, and alignment with the project vision: with "Priority:" as label.
	
	RESPONSE FORMAT:
	For each user story:
	- The user story
	- Its Priority

	EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
	1. As a user, I want to experience immersive graphics in the game so that I can be fully engaged in the virtual environment."
	Priority: High

	2. As a user, I want the game to have accessibility features for players with disabilities so that everyone can enjoy the game.
	Priority: Medium

	...

	8. As a user, I want diverse cultural elements and representation in the game world, to feel connected and represented.    
	Priority: Low

	MappingPrompt = `
	TASK DESCRIPTION:
	Generate mappings between given user stories and goals outlined for a software development project, including reasoning for each mapping. Explicitly include the reasoning with a 'Reasoning:' label. Additionally, identify and label the underlying concepts that guide the project's development efforts with a 'Concept:' label.

	INPUT FORMAT:
	Provide a list of user stories and goals. Each user story and goal should be accompanied by a brief description.

	CRITERIA:
	The model should map each user story to the corresponding goal from the provided list and explicitly provide the reasoning behind the mapping with a 'Reasoning:' label. If a user story does not directly align with any goal, the model should indicate so with an explanation also preceded by the 'Reasoning:' label. Additionally, the model should identify and label the underlying concepts that guide the project's development efforts with a 'Concept:' label.

	RESPONSE FORMAT:
	For each mapping, the model's response should include:
	- The user story and the corresponding goal.
	- A 'Reasoning:' label followed by the rationale for the mapping.
	- A 'Concept:' label followed by the underlying concept that guides the project's development efforts.
	If a user story does not align with any goal, it should be flagged as an isolated user story with reasonings for the lack of alignment, also following the 'Reasoning:' label.

	EXAMPLE INPUT:
	User Stories:
	1. As a user, I want to be able to select between trend following and mean reversion strategies so that I can optimize my cryptocurrency trading based on my preferred investment style and market conditions.
	2. As a user, I want to set the time horizon for my trades (short-term, medium-term, or long-term) to align with my risk tolerance and profit goals.
	Goals:
	1. Develop a trading system that supports both trend following and mean reversion strategies.
	2. Integrate trading options for various timeframes, including short-term, medium-term, and long-term strategies.

	EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
	1. User Story 1 maps to Goal 1.
	Reasoning: The desire to select between trading strategies directly supports the goal of developing a trading system with versatile strategy options.
	Concept: Versatility in trading strategies.
	...
	3. User Story 2 does not directly align with any specific goal.
	Reasoning: The request for personalized recommendations suggests a need for an adaptive AI component, which is not explicitly covered in the outlined goals. This might indicate a new area for development or an extension of existing goals.
	Concept: Adaptive AI recommendations.

	ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
	Ensure the reasoning is clear, concise, and directly connects the user's needs or desires with the goals' intent and outcomes. Use the 'Reasoning:' label to clearly separate the rationale from the mapping for easy reading and comprehension. Similarly, use the 'Concept:' label to explicitly identify the underlying concepts guiding the project's development efforts.
