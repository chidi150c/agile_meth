The Development Team

Define Structs for Team Roles: Create Go structs for each team role, such as Developer, Tester, and Designer. Each struct will have fields to represent relevant attributes, such as name, expertise, and any other necessary information.

Implement Methods for Each Role: Define methods within each struct to represent the tasks and responsibilities associated with that role. For example:

The Developer struct might have methods for coding user stories, debugging code, and integrating changes.
The Tester struct might have methods for writing test cases, executing tests, and reporting bugs.
The Designer struct might have methods for creating user interface designs, prototyping, and gathering user feedback.
Use Interfaces for Common Behavior: Define an interface, such as TeamMember, that includes common behaviors shared among team roles. Each struct should implement this interface, ensuring that they all have the same set of methods, even though they may implement them differently.

Instantiate Team Members: Create instances of each struct to represent individual team members within the Agile team. Set their attributes and call their methods as needed to simulate their work on various tasks and user stories.

Invoke Methods in Response to Events: Simulate the Agile development process by invoking the appropriate methods on the team members in response to events. For example, when a user story is assigned to a developer, call the WorkOn method of the Developer struct to simulate coding that user story.

By following this method, you can effectively simulate the work of different team roles within an Agile development team using Go structs and interfaces. This approach allows for flexibility and scalability in modeling various aspects of the development process and can be extended to include additional roles or behaviors as needed.
