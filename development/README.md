The Development Team

Define Structs for Team Roles: Create Go structs for each team role, such as Developer, Tester, and Designer. Each struct will have fields to represent relevant attributes, such as name, expertise, and any other necessary information.

Implement Methods for Each Role: Define methods within each struct to represent the tasks and responsibilities associated with that role. For example:

The Developer struct might have methods for coding user stories, debugging code, and integrating changes.
The Tester struct might have methods for writing test cases, executing tests, and reporting bugs.
The Designer struct might have methods for creating user interface designs, prototyping, and gathering user feedback.
Use Interfaces for Common Behavior: Define an interface, such as TeamMember, that includes common behaviors shared among team roles. Each struct should implement this interface, ensuring that they all have the same set of methods, even though they may implement them differently.

Instantiate Team Members: Create instances of each struct to represent individual team members within the Agile team. Set their attributes and call their methods as needed to simulate their work on various tasks and user stories.

Invoke Methods in Response to Events: Simulate the Agile development process by invoking the appropriate methods on the team members in response to events. For example, when a user story is assigned to a developer, call the WorkOn method of the Developer struct to simulate coding that user story.

By following this method, you can effectively simulate the work of different team roles within an Agile development team using Go structs and interfaces. This approach allows for flexibility and scalability in modeling various aspects of the development process and can be extended to include additional roles or behaviors as needed.


The Vision
Build a world wide game that millions around the world could play in the virtual environment generated by AI
Adopt Agile methodology and step by step code by code session by session implement the game using agile methodology 

The Goal
Breakdown the vision into goals to provide a high-level roadmap for the project and set clear objectives for the team. Make sure the goals are in relation to the vision to ensure they adequately address the core elements of the vision:


As a player, I want to create a customizable avatar to represent myself in the virtual world.
As a player, I want to explore diverse and immersive environments generated by AI, including forests, cities, and underwater worlds.
As a player, I want to interact with other players from around the world in real-time, forming alliances, competing in challenges, and collaborating on quests.
As a player, I want to discover and collect rare items, resources, and artifacts scattered throughout the virtual world.
As a player, I want to engage in various activities and mini-games, such as crafting, fishing, and racing, to earn rewards and experience points.
As a player, I want to join or create guilds and participate in large-scale events and battles against other guilds for control and dominance.
As a player, I want to customize and upgrade my virtual home or base, showcasing my achievements and personal style.
As a player, I want to embark on epic quests and story-driven missions, uncovering mysteries, solving puzzles, and defeating powerful foes.
As a player, I want to participate in seasonal events, festivals, and competitions hosted by the game developers, earning exclusive rewards and recognition.
As a player, I want to experience dynamic weather systems, day-night cycles, and seasonal changes that affect gameplay and environment interactions.
